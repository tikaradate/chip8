# CHIP-8 Emulator
This project had the objective of learning about Rust, about emulation and a bit about ~~SDL~~\* [ggez](https://ggez.rs/).

###### \*turns out SDL was too ambitious for this project

I used [this article](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/) and the [CHIP-8 wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) as guides.

### To execute:
    cargo run roms/{ROM}
